# QUEUEY PROJECT
I completely this project rather quickly using data_type as you set it up.<br>
I then decided to do a little bit more and used CHAT GPT to help me use Generics.<br>
I attempted to use pydantic, but got confused with it taking care of init, so abandoned it for now.<br>
Generic and TypeVar seems very straight forward.<br>
I also used Chat GPT to help build a watcher script. This allowed for me to see the code run everytime I ran `:w` in vim.<br>
So added that to the repository. To check it out, install `requirements.txt` and run `python watcher.py` in one Terminal. <br>
Now open my `queuey.py` file in vim in another terminal, and either edit it or just send `:w`. Pretty neat!
